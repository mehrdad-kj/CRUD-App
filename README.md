# React + TypeScript + Vite + React Query + Antd + Axios + Json-Server 

This is a CRUD app that shows fake users data with help of json-server in a table. All CRUD actions are available in this app. 
Also you can filter the table in 2 ways. one with a input that filters table based on what you typed, and another one is 
a filter by select.

-- clone app
-- npm install
-- npm run dev 

# note1: I set up running the json server with the npm run dev so it is not needed to run json server seperately. 

# note 2: I tried to deploy the app with gh-pages but apperantly json-server cant be runned dynamicly. but after you run the app you can see it online with the following link:
